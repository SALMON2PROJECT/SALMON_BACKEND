 are observed in very high redshifts We explore the possibility that SMBH form from the coherent waves of Bose-Einstein
  condensate BEC which are supposed to form the dark matter We first study the isotropic and anisotropic collapses of BEC
   We find the BEC wave can easily collapse to form SMBH but the realistic amount of angular momentum completely prevents the
    collapse We further explore the Axion case with attractive interaction and find the moderate mass ratio between the SMBH and the dark halo around it
    We also obtain the mass distribution function of BH within a single galaxyIntroduction Supermassive black holes SMBH of mass Mare observed in the most of
    the galaxies kormendy All of them are located in the galactic center and not a small amount of SMBHs are already formed very early in the cosmic history of redshift
     zBanadosMoreover masses of the SMBH have strong correlation with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge MBHkormendy All of these properties strongly indicate
     that the SMBH plays the central role in the galaxy history and even defines the center of the galaxy MorikawaThen the principal question would be the origin of these
      SMBH Individual questions related to the SMBH formation will beuniversality in the Universe Why most of the galaxies harbor SMBH of huge sizeMlocation in the galaxy Why all
      the SMBH is located at the center of the galaxy causal relation with galaxy Why SMBH form so early at least as z correlation with galaxy Why SMBH is firmly correlated with the galaxy bulge MBHcorrelation with dark halo DHWhy SMBH mass is correlated with the galaxy dark halo mass MDH as MBHMDH There have been many literature in the past trying to answer these questions Most of them have been generally summarized in the diagram in ReesBasic mechanism in these is the gas collapse to form the primordial black holes BHfollowed by the coalescence of them or the accretion of the gas on them Relatively heavy BH is expected from the early population stars of massM Volonteri The gas heating tends to prevent the effective accretion If a huge gas clump directly collapses to form a black hole of sizeM Oh then the Eddington accretion rate can explain the early formation of SMBH although some tuning of parameters is needed All of these theories assume that the SMBHs are formed by baryons or fermions Contrary to them we now would like to explore another possibility that the SMBHs are formed by the dark matter DM or bosons in particular by the quantum condensed boson fields such as the Bose-Einstein condensation BECThe quantum condensation of bosons behaves very differently from fermions or from the fermion condensations and forms the macroscopic coherent wave If the DM is formed from light bosons then it can easily form the quantum condensates which may coherently collapse to form SMBH in the early stage NishiyamaThen the stars and their clusters are formed around these SMBH afterward All the above individual questions naturally suggest that the SMBH defines the center of the galaxy first SMBH can be formed before stars and galaxies even at zand the SMBH may trigger the subsequent star and galaxy formation at later time z In other words the co-evolution might be very rapid in the early stage and the galaxy merger would not be the dominant mechanism at the SMBH formation stage Heckman We now focus on the first stage of this scenario i e the early formation of SMBH The subsequent star and galaxy evolution will be discussed in separate articles extending Morikawaand including observational predictions Thus we explore in this paper the possibility of the collapse of the coherent boson field which may be the main component of the dark matter DMFukuyamaOur problem is now extended to the question of how SMBH and dark halo DHbeing two different forms of DM are separated from each other In the next sectionwe clarify how the BEC DM is possible and how the condensation evolves in the Universe In sectionwe explore the collapsing dynamics in various conditions and show the BEC DM actually collapses to form SMBH DH In sectionwe consider the Axion model for BEC-DM and try to derive the time and mass scales of the SMBH In the last section we conclude our study and describe the subsequent scenario for the galaxy formation triggered by the SMBHHow do SMBHs form We now consider how the cosmic Bose-Einstein condensation BEC is possible as dark matter DM and dark energyDEFukuyama Fukuyama Fukuyama Schive The critical temperature below which the BEC takes place is given by kTcrh n m where n is the number density of the boson particle of mass m and is the zeta function On the other hand the cosmic DM density evolution is given by nnm h T T where T is the temperature of the DM and the suffixdenotes the present time This expression for n is obtained by the conservation of the entropy s per number density s nlne h m T TnIt is apparent that Eqs have the same proportionality T nTherefore once the Universe enters into the phase of BEC it stays in BEC in the later evolution provided the process is adiabatic The Universe would be mostly adiabatic but locally violated for example in the violent procesPhysicalsciences Supermassiveblackholes Velocitydispersion Darkmatterhalo Exoticmatter Physicalcosmology Galaxies Celestialmechanics Naturalsciences Astronomy
